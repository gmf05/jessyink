# Introduction #

This feature originated from the request to have automatic slide numbering. Currently, there are three types of auto-texts available in JessyInk: the slide title, the slide number and the number of slides.

# Details #

The JessyInk "auto-texts" extension can be used to specify the desired substitution. First, a stand-in text has to be created. This text will later be substituted in the browser. The stand-in text should have the size, font and position that is desired for the auto-text. After selecting the text, the "auto-text" extension is opened and the type of text to be substituted is selected. Pressing "apply" saves the changes. No immediate change will be seen in Inkscape. However, in the browser the selected text will be substituted by the slide name, slide number of number of slides, depending on the selection.

This feature is especially useful in combination with the master slide. Auto-texts specified on the master slide, will be substituted correctly on every slide, making it easy to place slide titles or number on every slide.
