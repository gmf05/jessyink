# Introduction #

Starting from version 1.3 of JessyInk it is possible to choose custom key bindings. For each of the modes available in JessyInk a set of actions has been defined. Using the corresponding Inkscape extension, it is possible to choose key bindings for these actions by simply entering the character into the text field next to the action. To assign more than one key, simply separate the characters by a comma. To assign special keys (e.g. the enter key or arrow keys) descriptions of these keys can be used. The following descriptions are implemented:

| **key** | **description** |
|:--------|:----------------|
| return key | RETURN          |
| arrow up | UP              |
| arrow down | DOWN            |
| arrow left | LEFT            |
| arrow right | RIGHT           |
| page up | PAGE\_UP        |
| page down | PAGE\_DOWN      |
| space bar | SPACE           |
| home key | HOME            |
| end key | END             |
