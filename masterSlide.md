# Introduction #

One of the most requested features, was the implementation of a master slide. The latest version of JessyInk supports this feature now!

# Details #

Using the JessyInk "master slide"-extension, a master slide can be specified. To do so, the extension is selected from the menu and the name of layer that shall be used as the master slide is entered. Pressing "apply" sets the specified layer as the master slide. Only one layer can be used as the master slide. Leaving the name field blank and pressing "apply" unsets the master slide. The contents of this slide will be copied onto every slide as a backdrop.

The master slide feature is especially helpful in combination with the auto-text substitution. Defining auto-texts on the master slide, it is easy to have the slide name or number automatically inserted on every slide. Although, effects can also be used on the master slide and work as expected throughout the presentation, I am not quite sure, if this "side-effect" will actually be helpful. Transitions set for the master slide will be used as the default transitions.
