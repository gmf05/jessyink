# Introduction #

A feature that I would have liked to have in the past, but could never find in any presentation programme, was a way to display several slides without leaving the presentation. This is especially handy for the question session after the presentation. This feature is now available in JessyInk!

# Details #

The index sheet feature is enabled automatically. There is no manual installation necessary. By pressing "i" on your keyboard will toggle between the normal presentation and the index sheet.

After pressing "i" once an index sheet showing nine slides in three rows will be displayed. Slides containing effects will be displayed in their end state (_i.e._ what they look like after all effects are played). The active slide is highlighted, while all other slides are shown semi-transparently. Using the arrow keys, the active slide can be changed, as reflected by the highlighting. Pressing "i" again, continues the presentation with the active slide in the initial state (_i.e._ before any effects are played).
